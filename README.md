## Hi I'm Rafael 👋🏼

I'm a researcher specializing in artificial intelligence, currently pursuing my studies at the University of Zurich and conducting advanced research at the **Poggio Lab** at MIT. My work at MIT focuses on the intersection of computational neuroscience and machine learning, under the guidance of Professor Tomaso Poggio.

- **Current Focus**:
  - 🔬 **[Poggio Lab at MIT](https://poggio-lab.mit.edu/)**: Engaged in cutting-edge research on the mathematics of statistical learning theory. My research aims to deepen our understanding of how the brain processes information and how these processes can be effectively modeled computationally.

- **Past Projects**:
  - 🚀 **[Swissloop](https://swissloop.ch/)**: Contributed to advancing hyperloop technology as part of the Swissloop team.
  - ⛏ **[Swissloop Tunneling](https://swisslooptunneling.ch/)**: Worked on strategizing and developing new tunneling technologies for next-generation transportation.
  - 🤝 **[Swiss Hyperloop Alliance](https://swissloop.ch/partners/)**: Collaborated with various organizations to promote the development of hyperloop infrastructure in Europe.
